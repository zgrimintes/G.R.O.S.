# G.R.O.S.
Scrips on a small game I am working on

G.R.O.S. (short fort Get Rid Of Sheeps) is a small game I wanted to make in unity. 
You will be playing as a goat trying to "get rid" of all the sheeps you find.
I will be updating these repositories as I continue making my game.
If you see this and want to help don't hesitate! I am a begginer and I'm waiting for any improvement tips!
